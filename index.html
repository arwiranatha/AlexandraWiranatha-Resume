        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Alexandra Wiranatha and I am 19 years old. I am studying to become a business market manager and I am seeking knowledge to know all the secrets to becoming a successful manager for your company. 
The current job I have is in the production line at Panera Bread and I am planning to work my way up to become a shift lead or a manager. I have worked at many other jobs to find the perfect job that is a right fit for me and I believe I can get far with Panera Bread. 
My real goal in life is to become a marketing manager for Disneyland. It has always been my dream to work with Disneyland and help promote the beautiful things that come with Disneyland. Some people do not believe Disneyland is anything special or is a lot of money, but I truly believe it is one of the most magical places to visit. I want to be able to reach people across the world to let them know what Disneyland has to offer them. I have been going to Disneyland for a few years now and the place itself has never gotten boring to me. There are always new items, foods, and rides that are being placed which makes me go more often than other people. I always try to find out the new events taking place to analyze how they got this message to people who may not be obsessed with Disneyland as much as I am. 
There are many videos that are created by regular people who are not paid by Disneyland that promote their newest items. 

<br><br>

        A little about me is I am very shy when you first meet me but once you get to know me I will start opening up slowly. It takes me a while to feel comfortable with people I do not know especially if there is not a certain connection between us. I will work hard no matter the relationship status I have in any company. I will work my way hard to the top to provide for my family and support myself. Some hobbies I like to do is film everything in sight because I believe memories are the most important thing to me because I usually forget little things if I do not record them. I also like to edit my videos to post them on social media such as Youtube, TikTok, and Instagram. That is how I expressed myself as a child. I would have a lot of alone time and I would start recording little snippets of my life even if it was boring. When I look back at the videos I get a nostalgic feeling because it feels like I am a whole new person from the person in the video because I learn so much every day that I already have a different mindset.
